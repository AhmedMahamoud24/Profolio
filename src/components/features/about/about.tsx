        I&apos;m a 23-year-old self-taught frontend developer. I found my
        passion for programming after discovering my brother was doing it. What
        kept me on this journey is that I always find learning new things
        exciting and facing unfamiliar challenges. In addition to coding, I
        enjoy building side projects, writing blog posts, and reading books.
        When I&apos;m not doing anything coding-related, I enjoy spending time
        with my family and working out.
